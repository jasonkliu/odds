# odds [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jasonkliu/odds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jasonkliu/odds)

Either you or your friend suggests a dare and you want them to do it.  This happens by making them lose 'odds'.

For example, if I said, "Hey, odds you go jump over that fence?" He would then give a number, for example "20". On the count of 3, we would both say a number between 1 and 20 at the same time, and if it's the same number he has to do it.

The person receiving the odds is the one who decides what number to pick from.
